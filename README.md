Problem Statement: "The Many Minds of Meera – A Calculator That Thinks Beyond"

Meera, an MCA student known for juggling both logic and lifestyle, often found herself switching between apps: one to solve equations, another to calculate BMI, and yet another for simple day-to-day arithmetic. Tired of this digital clutter, she thought, “Why not build one smart calculator that does it all?”

 

Imagine Meera opening a web-based calculator that’s more than just numbers and symbols. It’s an all-in-one digital tool that helps her:

Perform basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)

Calculate BMI with her height and weight inputs

Compute percentages, square roots, or powers

Maybe even convert units like inches to cm, Celsius to Fahrenheit, or days to minutes

 

Your task? Build this multi-utility calculator—a tool that adapts to the user’s intent, all on a single interface or split across minimal views.

 

The user should be able to:

Enter required inputs using a clean, interactive interface

Navigate easily between different modes (Basic, BMI, etc.)

View all calculations without page refreshes

Have the ability to clear or reset individual modes

All data should be managed within the browser itself, using JavaScript’s local capabilities. There’s no need to store user data permanently, but ensure that the interactions are smooth and stateful. The smarter and more intuitive the design, the better.

ReactJS may be used to enhance the experience—but the core lies in your logic, layout, and creativity.

Also you can analyse the statement first, and think some creative ideas to enhance the solution. So that more and more students like meera can be helped from juggling up for these type of calculations.

Thank You
